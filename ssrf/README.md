## Basic SSRF against the local server
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-localhost

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Browse to ``/admin`` and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
2. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
3. Change the URL in the ``stockApi`` parameter to ``http://localhost/admin``. This should display the administration interface.
4. Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:
```
http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
```
5. Submit this URL in the ``stockApi`` parameter, to deliver the SSRF attack.

## Basic SSRF against another back-end system
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
2. Click "Clear ยง", change the ``stockApi`` parameter to ``http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin`` then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number 1), click "Add ยง".
3. Switch to the Payloads tab, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To" and "Step" boxes respectively.
4. Click "Start attack".
5. Click on the "Status" column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of 200, showing an admin interface.
6. Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the ``stockApi`` to: ``/admin/delete?username=carlos``

## SSRF with blacklist-based input filter
Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Solution
1. Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
2. Change the URL in the ``stockApi`` parameter to ``http://127.0.0.1/`` and observe that the request is blocked.
3. Bypass the block by changing the URL to: ``http://127.1/``
4. Change the URL to ``http://127.1/admin`` and observe that the URL is blocked again.
5. Obfuscate the "a" by double-URL encoding it to ``%2561`` to access the admin interface and delete the target user.
